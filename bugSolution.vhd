The solution addresses the problem by using a named constant for the value 10, making the comparison clearer and aiding synthesis optimization. 

```vhdl
entity example_solution is
  generic (
    g_value : integer := 10
  );
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    out_signal : out std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of example_solution is
  constant VALUE_TO_COMPARE : integer := 10; --Added Constant for clarity
begin
  process (clk) is
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if g_value = VALUE_TO_COMPARE then -- comparison using the constant
        out_signal <= '1';
      else
        out_signal <= '0';
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;```
